      to detect malicious URLS using different models widely used in machine\r
      learning and in subsequent experiments we compare the performances of\r

      associated website or characteristics relating to network traffic, such\r

      decision trees to create a robust and accurate classifier. Given a\r
      training dataset (x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2), . . . ,(x_n, y_n) where x_i\r
      represents the feature vector of the i-th sample and y_i is its\r
      corresponding labell, Random Forest constructs an ensemble of decision\r
      trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features.\r
      The final prediction is determined by aggregating the predictions of all\r
      trees through majority voting or averaging. Mathematically, the Random\r
      Forest prediction is given where yË† is the predicted label, h_t(x) is the\r
      prediction of the t-th decision tree and mode returns the most frequent\r
      label. Random Forest reduces overfitting by introducing randomness through\r
      data and feature subsampling. It also provides measures of feature\r
      importance based on the average depth or decrease in impurity caused by\r
      splitting on a particular feature. Random Forest is widely used for\r
      classification and regression tasks due to its robustness, accuracy, and\r
      ability to handle high-dimensional data.`;return{c(){e=f("h1"),e.textContent=s,n=_(),t=f("h3"),t.textContent=i,l=_(),o=f("h2"),o.textContent=y,p=_(),d=f("h3"),d.textContent=x,this.h()},l(a){e=m(a,"H1",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),g(e)!=="svelte-apdl53"&&(e.textContent=s),n=v(a),t=m(a,"H3",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),g(t)!=="svelte-1xqwecg"&&(t.textContent=i),l=v(a),o=m(a,"H2",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),g(o)!=="svelte-1hcu372"&&(o.textContent=y),p=v(a),d=m(a,"H3",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),g(d)!=="svelte-u8gk8o"&&(d.textContent=x),this.h()},h(){b(e,"class","svelte-fiqfg5"),b(o,"class","svelte-fiqfg5")},m(a,u){c(a,e,u),c(a,n,u),c(a,t,u),c(a,l,u),c(a,o,u),c(a,p,u),c(a,d,u)},p:w,d(a){a&&(r(e),r(n),r(t),r(l),r(o),r(p),r(d))}}}function S(h){let e,s,n;return s=new j({props:{$$slots:{default:[I]},$$scope:{ctx:h}}}),{c(){e=f("div"),q(s.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(t){e=m(t,"DIV",{class:!0});var i=H(e);L(s.$$.fragment,i),i.forEach(r),this.h()},h(){b(e,"class","Main svelte-fiqfg5")},m(t,i){c(t,e,i),k(s,e,null),n=!0},p(t,[i]){const l={};i&1&&(l.$$scope={dirty:i,ctx:t}),s.$set(l)},i(t){n||(F(s.$$.fragment,t),n=!0)},o(t){M(s.$$.fragment,t),n=!1},d(t){t&&r(e),U(s)}}}class T extends C{constructor(e){super(),R(this,e,null,S,$,{})}}function D(h){let e,s;return e=new T({}),{c(){q(e.$$.fragment)},l(n){L(e.$$.fragment,n)},m(n,t){k(e,n,t),s=!0},p:w,i(n){s||(F(e.$$.fragment,n),s=!0)},o(n){M(e.$$.fragment,n),s=!1},d(n){U(e,n)}}}class A extends C{constructor(e){super(),R(this,e,null,D,$,{})}}export{A as component};
